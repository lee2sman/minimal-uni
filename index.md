Minimal Uni is a base structure that can be used to create a website for a college class, or a personal blog, wiki or other website.

 The repo can be found and downloaded or forked from [here](https://github.com/lee2sman/minimal-uni).

It is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site builder, hosted on GitHub pages. The theme is meant to be modified. At the very least, change the title and the text on index.md and pages/about.md. Modify the border color of the frame around the page and text and accent colors inside ```_data/layout.yml```.

Created by [Lee Tusman](http://leetusman.com).
